        <h1>C and C++</h1>
        <p class="lead">The C programming language was originally developed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system by Dennis Ritchie. <br>The C language, which is quite simple, is not tied to any particular hardware or system. <br>This makes it easier for a user to write programs that will run without many (or any) changes on practically all machines.
            <br>The C language is often called a middle-level computer language as it combines the elements of high-level languages with the functionalism of assembly language. <br>C programming allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and addresses—giving the programmer more control over exactly how the program will behave and more direct access to the mechanics of the underlying hardware.
            <br>C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers. The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants.
            <br>C++ is an enhanced version of the C language. C++ includes everything that’s part of C and adds support for object-oriented programming (OOP). <br> In addition, C++ also contains many improvements and features that make it a “better C,” independent of object oriented programming.
            <br>The C++ language is actually extensible since we can define new types in such a way that they act just like the predefined types which are part of the standard language.
            <br>If you just use C++ as a better C, you will not be using all of its power. Like any quality tool, C++ must be used the way it was designed to be used to exploit its richness. <br>Some of the new features include encapsulation, inline function calls, overloading operators, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
        <h4>Why would I want to learn C or C++?</h4>
        <p class="lead">C and C++ are still two of the most popular programming languages out there. <br>The syntax and concepts of C, especially, has stood the test of time, and you can see them being carried on to other popular programming languages, even the modern ones, such as Go.
            <br>Even if you are going to build web applications or fancy web front-end components for the rest of your life, learning C will help you understand how software and hardware actually interact.
            <br>Besides, C and C++ are everywhere.
            <br>C in particular powers a lot more technology than we give it credit for.
            <br>On the other hand, some of your favorite software - possibly even the web browser you are reading this article on—is built on C++. <br>Knowing C is a good base, but in many cases, software development will require you to learn C++ and its paradigms.
            <br>If you want to develop software that needs to make the most out of a computer’s performance and capabilities—high-end desktop games, sophisticated productivity tools, or complex computationally intensive programs, for instance—or if you just want a programming language that lets you interact with a computer’s hardware directly, C and C++ are the languages for you.
            <br>So, why would you not want to learn C++ or C? It’s not like 25 years ago, when you might have had to invest in a proprietary compiler to get started—today you can certainly learn C++ free.</p>
