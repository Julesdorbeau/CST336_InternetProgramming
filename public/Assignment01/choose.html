        <h1>How to choose your programming language ?</h1>
        <p class="lead">You are a beginner and you are asking yourself the very first question that all beginners ask themselves:<br> which programming language to choose to learn to program?</p>
        <p class="lead">There is two possibilities : <br> Either you already know what you want to program: a mobile application, a website, a video game, a desktop application etc.<br> Or you are not sure ... but you know you want to learn to program! In both cases, the next criteria are applicable.</p>
        <h4>Criteria for choosing a programming language</h4>
        <p class="lead">Whether or not you know what type of project you want to work on, there are a number of criteria to take into account when choosing your first programming language.</p>
        <h4>Oldness and modernity of a language</h4>
        <p class="lead">Today, we are no longer programming as in 1980, you can imagine. Programming languages have evolved over the years.<br> Indeed, the way we program has evolved: this is what we call programming paradigms. <br>At first, we coded a list of instructions that the computer executed in a linear fashion, like a cooking recipe: this is procedural programming. It is used, for example, in the JavaScript, C, Pascal or Perl languages. <br>Then we moved on to object-oriented programming where we create and use objects that communicate with each other. As in JavaScript, Java, Python, C #, PHP, C ++, Ruby, Swift or Objective-C. <br>As you can see there are many languages ​​that allow this paradigm: it is the best known and most popular today. <br>Another paradigm is gaining popularity these days: functional programming. The principle is to code a chain of functions (in the mathematical sense of the term) which will not create side effects. Such a paradigm can be used in almost all programming languages. It's just how we use the language that matters.</p>
        <h4>Community and popularity</h4>
        <p class="lead">If you want to get a feel for the most popular languages at the moment, you can take a look at the StackOverflow 2019 survey on the subject. <br>You can also refer to the TIOBE index which lists the most popular programming languages each month based on different sources of information. <br>Learning a popular language will give you all the benefits of an online community. <br>It is not easy to learn a new programming language, it is even less easy to learn it alone. Having a community ready to help you is a major asset for learning a programming language quickly. <br>The more popular the language, the more resources you will find to learn it: books, blogs, video training, podcasts, conferences, Slack chat channels, YouTube channels, etc.</p>
        <h4>Frameworks and libraries available</h4>
        <p class="lead">Another effect of choosing a popular language is the richness of its environment. <br>To create a modern application, we frequently use a framework and libraries. A framework is a development framework: it is used to structure and orient the software architecture of your application. <br>A framework allows you to quickly create very complex applications while maintaining a flexible and easily maintainable software structure. <br>A library is simply a set of code written by a third party that can be reused in its own applications. A library makes it possible to facilitate development by not reinventing the wheel and to extend the possibilities of the programming language that we use. <br>For example, the Python language does not allow you to create basic graphical interfaces. But using the PyQT library, you can use the Python language to create programs with a graphical interface. <br>The larger and more active the community around a language, the more choices you will have in the frameworks and libraries available to develop your application.</p>
        <h4>Ease of learning</h4>
        <p class="lead">It is not easy to learn a new programming language, some are more difficult than others to learn. <br>There are so-called low-level languages and high-level languages. <br>Low-level languages such as Assembler or C language make it possible to create highly optimized programs close to the hardware on which it is run. <br>With these languages, for example, you have to manage memory usage yourself, which can be complicated for a beginner. <br>Conversely, high-level languages allow you to develop applications without worrying about hardware considerations. Tools (such as picking up crumbs for example to manage memory) allow you to carry out these very technical aspects for you.</p>
        <h4>Developer tools</h4>
        <p class="lead">For some languages ​​like C, you will need to compile your program first before you can run it. The C language is a so-called compiled language. <br>This requires installing a compilation chain and having additional technical knowledge that you need to acquire before you even start programming. It’s pretty frustrating.<br>Other so-called interpreted languages require few (if any!) Tools to install in order to start programming. You can for example start coding in JavaScript directly from your browser or from an online site! <br>Second, code editing can be made a lot easier by using a code editor. This tool will allow you to create source code more quickly and cleanly and to easily navigate through it compared to a simple text editor. <br>There is a wide choice of source code editors that support one or more programming languages.</p>
        <h4>Type of final project</h4>
        <p class="lead">Last but not least: your project. Some projects require the use of a particular language to be developed. <br>This is the case for example of native mobile applications on Android or iOS. This is the case with websites that always end up producing HTML / CSS. <br>For all these special cases, I have summarized your possibilities in several sections below.</p>
